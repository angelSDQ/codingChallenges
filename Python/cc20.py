"""ü§¨ Problem: Bleep Swear Words in a Sentence

üìù Description:
Write a function that receives a string sentence and returns a version where any swear word is censored.

The list of swear words to censor includes (case-sensitive): ["fuck", "shit", "hell", "carajo"]
Each censored word must be transformed as follows:
Keep the first and last character
Replace all characters in between with asterisks *
Maintain the original capitalization of the first and last character
Punctuation attached to the word (like hell. or shit!) must remain at the end, uncensored.

1 ‚â§ sentence.length ‚â§ 1000
Sentence contains printable ASCII characters. Words are separated by spaces. 
Swear words may include ending punctuation (e.g. "shit!")
You may assume punctuation only appears at the end of words

A single string sentence

üß† Output Format:
Return the sentence with swear words censored using the described rules.

"What the hell is this shit?"   "What the h**l is this s**t?"
