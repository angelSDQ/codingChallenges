# üí∏ Problem: Censor Dollar Amounts (Digits Only, Preserve Commas)
# Difficulty: Medium
# Category: String Manipulation / Censorship

# üìù Description:
# You are given a string contractText that may include monetary amounts written in USD format (e.g., $1,000,000.00).

# Your task is to censor each digit inside any dollar amount. The output must:

# Leave the dollar sign ($), commas (,), and decimal points (.) intact

# Replace every digit (0‚Äì9) within the dollar amount with an asterisk *

# Leave all non-currency parts of the string unchanged

# üîß Constraints:

# 1 ‚â§ contractText.length ‚â§ 2000

# Currency amounts always start with $

# A currency amount includes only digits, commas, and optionally a decimal part (e.g., .00)

# No space is present between $ and the digits

# There may be multiple currency amounts

# üß† Input Format:
# A single string contractText

# üß† Output Format:
# Return the string with each digit in a dollar amount replaced by *, keeping other characters unchanged.

# üîç Examples:

# Example 1:
# Input:
# "The contractor shall be paid $1,000,000.00 upon completion."
# Output:
# "The contractor shall be paid $*,***,***.** upon completion."

# Example 2:
# Input:
# "Deposit: $5000, Final: $25,000.99"
# Output:
# "Deposit: $****, Final: $**,***.**"

# Example 3:
# Input:
# "Fee: $99.95. Refund: $0.01"
# Output:
# "Fee: $**.**, Refund: $*.**"

# Example 4:
# Input:
# "No payments required."
# Output:
# "No payments required."
