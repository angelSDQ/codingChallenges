"""
ðŸ”’ Problem: Mask All But Last Four

Difficulty: Easy  
Category: String Manipulation / Masking

Description:
Given a string s, return a new string where *all characters except the last four* are replaced with the character '*'.

Use this to simulate hiding sensitive data like credit card numbers, phone numbers, or IDs.

Examples:
Input:  "1234567890"
Output: "******7890"

Input:  "abcdef"
Output: "**cdef"

Input:  "1234"
Output: "1234"

Input:  "hi"
Output: "hi"

Constraints:
â€¢  1 <= len(s) <= 100
â€¢  s contains only alphanumeric characters and symbols

"""

# define a function maskingString() and pass one parameter s
# def maskingString(s): 
#   create variable maskedWord set to empty string
#   maskedWord = ""
#   create variable unMasked set to empty string
#   unMasked = ""
#   create variable masked set to empty string
#   masked = ""
#   use if statement and len() method pass string s to check if less than or equal to 4
#   if len(s) <= 4:
#       return s
#   use elfi to check the len of s
#       elif len(s) > 4:
#           set values to unMasked and masked
#           unMasked = s[-4:]
#           masked = s[:-4]
#       use for loop to iterate on masked
#       for i in masked:
#           maskedWord += "*"
#       concatenate maskedWord + unMasked
#       return maskedWord + unMasked

# print(maskingString())
