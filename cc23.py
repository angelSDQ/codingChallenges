üíµ Problem: Censor USD Money Values (No Space, Preserve Formatting)
Difficulty: Medium  
Category: String Manipulation / Censorship

üìù Description:
You're given a string `text` that may include money values strictly in **USD format with no space**, such as:
- USD1000  
- USD1,000.00  
- USD2.5M  
- USD12.35B  
- usd450K

Your task is to **censor all digits (0‚Äì9)** in these values while preserving:
- The exact prefix `USD` or `usd` (case-insensitive)
- Commas `,`
- Decimal points `.`
- Suffixes like `K`, `M`, or `B` (case-insensitive)

üß∑ The match must follow this format:
‚Ä¢ Starts with `USD` or `usd`  
‚Ä¢ Immediately followed by a number  
‚Ä¢ May include commas  
‚Ä¢ May include a decimal and exactly 1‚Äì2 digits  
‚Ä¢ May end with a valid suffix (`K`, `M`, or `B`)  

üìå Digits in all valid money values must be replaced with asterisks `*`.

‚õî Do NOT censor:
- Any number without the `USD`/`usd` prefix  
- Values with a space after `USD`  
- Values embedded in words (e.g., "USDollars")

üîß Constraints:
‚Ä¢ 1 ‚â§ text.length ‚â§ 2000  
‚Ä¢ Currency values are **well-formed**  
‚Ä¢ `USD` prefix is case-insensitive but must be **attached** to the number (no space)

üß† Input Format:
A single string `text`

üß† Output Format:
Return the string with all **digits (0‚Äì9) in valid USD money values** replaced by `*`.

üîç Examples:

Example 1:  
Input:  
"The deal closed at USD1,000.00 today."  
Output:  
"The deal closed at USD*,***.** today."

Example 2:  
Input:  
"He earned USD2.5M last year."  
Output:  
"He earned USD*.*M last year."

Example 3:  
Input:  
"Invested in usd400K and withdrew USD1000000."  
Output:  
"Invested in usd***K and withdrew USD*******."

Example 4:  
Input:  
"Not valid: USD 500, USDollars, or 12345."  
Output:  
"Not valid: USD 500, USDollars, or 12345."

Example 5:  
Input:  
"Total cost is USD12,345.67 and bonus was USD25K."  
Output:  
"Total cost is USD**,***.** and bonus was USD**K."

Goals quick glance

create a func with hideMoneyVal()
given string text
with USD values ONLY. NO spaces
ONLY censor nums 0-9
Keep original format
KEEP 'USD' or 'usd'
KEEP Commas `,` & Decimal points `.` in the same order
KEEP Suffixes like `K`, `M`, or `B` same oriiginal order
